I want to start my student project and feature functionality. 

Please take a look at the @PRD.md and figure out a plan on how to attack it (please don't write any code)

Feel free to analysis the codebase before you start coming up with a plan. 

The entry point is: @App.tsx . 

The backend functions are located in @supabase. 

My types are in @database.types.ts and schemas in @migrations.

Remeber, no code yet, please analyze and come up with a plan and get sign off by me first. 



The main home page for /student should be a student dashboard. 

You should be able to quickly see a few different widget: 
- Projects
    - how many projects (active?) you currently have
    - Create a new project from the project registry
- Features
    - Current feature counts
- Validations
    - Current and recent validation counts
