# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview and Purpose

### 1.1 Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a new Group User Testing App aimed at helping AI Engineer Bootcamp participants (i.e., Gauntlet cohorts) collaborate on testing each other's projects. Inspired by Zendesk's feature set, the app will enable users to quickly upload short screen-share videos demonstrating whether features are working or not, allow peers to validate these features, and provide administrators (instructors, hiring partners) with a high-level dashboard to track overall project quality and completion. The platform leverages concepts like task pipelines, inbox queues, and admin dashboards from Zendesk to streamline feature testing and validation.

### 1.2 Goals and Objectives

- **Streamline Testing:** Simplify the testing process by providing a central platform for feature verification.
- **Collaborative Validation:** Encourage group feedback and validation, so multiple users can sign off on whether a feature is working.
- **Transparent Progress Tracking:** Provide an admin dashboard that consolidates which features are tested, who tested them, and their status.
- **Peer Learning:** Promote shared learning via short screen-share videos that demonstrate how features are (or are not) functioning.

## 2. Background and Problem Statement

In the AI Engineer Bootcamp, participants often work on complex projects with multiple features (ranging from 10 to 40+ items). Currently, testing is fragmented and often informal, with limited visibility into peer validation or admin oversight. This leads to:

- Lack of standardized testing documentation.
- Difficulty for admins/instructors to quickly assess project progress and quality.
- Missed learning opportunities to see how peers solve problems or confirm they are implementing features correctly.

The Group User Testing App aims to address these issues by creating a shared environment where participants can efficiently upload tests, share feedback, and track progress.

## 3. Key Features

### Project & Feature Registry

- Admins can create a Project Registry, from which students can create their own project instances.
- Admins can add features to the project registry that are required or optional.
- Students can create project instances from the project registry.
- Students have the ability to create or import a project's list of required features (e.g., "Sign Up," "Login," etc.).
- Each feature has a status indicator (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Successful Test, Failed Test).

### Screen-Share Video Upload

- Users can upload a ~15-second screen-share or screen recording showing the feature in action.
- Option to mark the feature as "Working" or "Not Working."
- Provide optional comments or notes to detail any issues.

### Peer Validation

- Testers can be added as testers and be assigned a given feature and upload their screen-share.
- An embedded browser within the testing page allows users to interact directly with the feature while recording their screen, without needing to leave the app. This includes access to project context such as feature requirements and previous validation notes, enabling more efficient and comprehensive testing.
- Each feature can require multiple validations (e.g., 3â€“5 testers must confirm it before it is considered completed).
- Peers can mark a feature as "Working" or "Needs Fixing."

### Collaborative Feedback

- Comment threads on each feature to discuss issues, bugs, or possible solutions.
- Notification system to alert project owners when a peer has tested/validated a feature.

### Admin Dashboard / Scorecard

- High-level view of each project registry, project, and feature's overall progress.
- Metrics include how many features are tested, number of validations, and status breakdown.
- Filtering and sorting by project, user, or feature to quickly identify blockers or incomplete tasks.

### User Roles

- **Student/User:** Can create projects from the project registry, add features, copy features from the registry, upload their own test videos, and validate their own tests.
- **Admin:** Has permissions to view all projects, see dashboards, and possibly override or finalize feature statuses.
- **Tester:** Can view test requests, upload test videos, and validate others' features.

### Ticket Management System

- **Testing Tickets**
  - Automatically created when features are ready for testing
  - Tracks feature validation status and assignments
  - Links to completed validations
  - Provides deadline management for testing tasks
  - Enables efficient distribution of testing workload

- **Support & Question Tickets**
  - AI-powered support bot provides immediate responses
  - Categorized by project, feature, or testing context
  - Escalation path to human support when needed
  - Knowledge base integration for common questions
  - Historical tracking of similar issues and resolutions
