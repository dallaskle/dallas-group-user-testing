create ticket when registry gets new feature after a project is created, they should be able to say if they want to add it to their project or not.
notifications can be new tickets in the queue?


for ticket system, seems like maybe you have a single ticket instance which tracks the progress and current or assigned reviewer. Then you can use an action log and a audit log to track behavior and activity. Then maybe another messages db that actually holds the communication interaction.
