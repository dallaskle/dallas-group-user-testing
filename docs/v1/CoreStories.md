### Project & Feature Registry

- Admins can create a Project Registry, from which students can create their own project instances.
- Admins can add features to the project registry that are required or optional.
- Students can create project instances from the project registry.
- Students have the ability to create or import a project's list of required features (e.g., "Sign Up," "Login," etc.).
- Each feature has a status indicator (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Successful Test, Failed Test).

### Screen-Share Video Upload

- Users can upload a ~15-second screen-share or screen recording showing the feature in action.
- Option to mark the feature as "Working" or "Not Working."
- Provide optional comments or notes to detail any issues.

### Peer Validation

- Testers can be added as testers and be assigned a given feature and upload their screen-share.
- An embedded browser within the testing page allows users to interact directly with the feature while recording their screen, without needing to leave the app. This includes access to project context such as feature requirements and previous validation notes, enabling more efficient and comprehensive testing.
- Each feature can require multiple validations (e.g., 3â€“5 testers must confirm it before it is considered completed).
- Peers can mark a feature as "Working" or "Needs Fixing."

### Collaborative Feedback

- Comment threads on each feature to discuss issues, bugs, or possible solutions.
- Notification system to alert project owners when a peer has tested/validated a feature.
