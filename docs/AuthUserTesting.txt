I'll create a comprehensive testing checklist for the current authentication implementation:
1. Registration Testing
[ ] Test valid registration with student role
1. Fill out registration form with valid data
Verify success message
3. Check email for verification link
Verify database entry created with correct role
[ ] Test valid registration with tester role
Fill out registration form with valid data
2. Verify success message
3. Check email for verification link
Verify database entry created with correct role
[ ] Test form validation
[ ] Empty fields
[ ] Invalid email format
[ ] Password requirements (length, uppercase, lowercase, number)

2. Email Verification Testing
[ ] Test verification flow
Register new account
Click verification link in email
Verify redirect to login
Verify user status updated in database

Enter valid credentials
Verify successful login
3. Verify correct redirect to dashboard
Verify session stored in auth store

4. Authentication State
[ ] Test session persistence
Login successfully
Refresh page
Verify still logged in
Verify user data preserved
