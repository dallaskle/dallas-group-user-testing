## Step-by-Step Plan for a Student Dashboard

Below is a structured plan (in pseudocode) describing how to enhance the Student Dashboard so that it provides the best high-level view of each student’s projects, features, validations, and tickets.

---

### 1. Gather Requirements

1. From the PRD, note that:
   - Students want an overview of their projects, quick progress indicators for each, and easy access to further details.
   - A quick snapshot of validations (e.g., successful vs. needed), newly created features, recent testing tickets, etc.
   - The dashboard should help students quickly see overall project health, urgent tasks, and next steps.

2. From existing code:
   - Student data is fetched via projects.api.ts, validations.api.ts, comments.api.ts, and tickets.api.ts.
   - The detail pages (@ProjectDetailsPage and @FeatureDetailsPage) already provide in-depth information. The dashboard should be a summary that funnels into these details.
   - The existing StudentDashboard.tsx uses <ProjectsWidget />, <FeaturesWidget />, and <ValidationsWidget /> placeholders. We can refine these or replace them depending on final design.

---

### 2. Data to Display

Pseudocode describing which data points to show on the Student Dashboard:

1. List of Projects with their:
   - project.name  
   - number of total features, total validations, and overall validation progress  
   - link to or quick action button to open the project details page

2. Overall Validation Metrics:
   - Aggregated across all projects (e.g., total features validated out of total required validations, or average validation completion percentage)
   - Possibly highlight “Needs Fixing” or “Failed Test” features so they don’t get lost

3. Recent Activity (optional, but highly beneficial):
   - List of recently updated features or validations the student created
   - "Latest Comments" or “Recent Tickets” that might need attention
   - Summaries of newly assigned testers or upcoming deadlines for testing tickets

4. Ticket Summary:
   - If your app differentiates tickets by “open,” “in_progress,” and “resolved,” provide a high-level count
   - Possibly highlight “High Priority” open tickets or tickets nearing deadline

5. Quick Links:
   - Button for “Create Project”
   - Button for “View All Tickets”
   - Option to go to “Project Registries” if needed

---

### 3. Layout and Structure

Pseudocode layout (assume using a grid within TailwindCSS classes and a container for the main content):

1. Container for the entire dashboard:
   ```
   <div class="container mx-auto py-8">
     ...Main content...
   </div>
   ```
2. Headline and welcome message:
   ```
   <div class="mb-8">
     <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Welcome, (studentName)!</h1>
     <p class="text-gray-500">Here's your current project and testing overview.</p>
   </div>
   ```
3. Use a grid with multiple “Cards” or “Widgets”:
   - A “My Projects” card listing each project’s quick stats
   - A “Validation Progress” card that merges all projects or showcases a combined progress bar
   - A “Recent Activities / Recent Tickets” card

4. Provide accessible navigation / CTA buttons:
   - “Create Project” button
   - “View All Tickets” button

### 4. Implementation Details (High-Level Pseudocode)

Below is a high-level breakdown of how the new dashboard could fetch data and display it in separate components:

1. Fetch Data:
   - CALL projectsApi.getProjects(studentId):
     - returns an array of projects, each having features[] and validation counts
   - CALL ticketsApi.list({ filterByStudentId: studentId, status: 'open' }) (if relevant):
     - returns a summary of open tickets for that student to display on the dashboard
   - (Optional) Combine these calls into a single supabase function or handle them concurrently if needed for performance

2. State Management (e.g., in StudentDashboard component):
   ```
   const [projects, setProjects] = useState<ProjectWithRegistry[]>([])
   const [tickets, setTickets] = useState<TicketResponse[]>([])
   const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState<boolean>(true)

   useEffect(() => {
     async function loadData() {
       setIsLoading(true)
       try {
         // fetch projects in parallel with tickets
         const [projectsData, ticketsData] = await Promise.all([
           projectsApi.getProjects(studentId),
           ticketsApi.list({ studentId, status: 'open' })
         ])
         setProjects(projectsData)
         setTickets(ticketsData.tickets) // or however your API returns them
       } finally {
         setIsLoading(false)
       }
     }
     loadData()
   }, [studentId])
   ```

3. Summarize Each Project’s Stats:
   - For each project in projects[]:
     - sum up validations: project.features.reduce(...)
     - compute overall % validated vs. required
     - track “Not Started,” “In Progress,” “Failed Test,” “Successful Test” counts
     - store these in local or derived variables, e.g., “projectMetrics[]”

4. Render Each Section in a “Widget” or “Card”:
   - “My Projects Widget”:
     - For each project:
       - Project name
       - (x / y validations) or (x% complete)
       - CTA button linking to the project details
   - “Validation Progress Widget”:
     - Combine total validations from all projects
     - Render a progress bar with “(currentValidations / totalRequiredValidations) * 100%”
   - “Tickets/Activity Widget”:
     - Show open tickets relevant to the user
     - Possibly filter to highlight near-deadline tickets
     - Provide a link to ticket details or a ticket list

5. Provide Good Navigation & CTAs:
   - Each “widget” has a clearly labeled button or link to the deeper pages:
     - “View Project” → opens ProjectDetailsPage
     - “View Tickets” → opens TicketDetailsPage or TicketsPage
     - “Add New Project” → opens a dialog or route that leads to project creation

---

### 5. UX / UI Considerations

1. Prioritize the Data Display:
   - Students should see “which project is in trouble?” or “which feature needs immediate attention?” 
   - Possibly highlight any project that has a “Failed Test” or “High Priority Ticket” in red or with an icon.

2. Make it Scannable:
   - Summaries at the top-level (like a row of stats: total projects, total features, overall validation %)
   - Then break down in separate cards or horizontal sections.

3. Handle Loading and Error States:
   - If isLoading is true, show a spinner or skeleton
   - If an error occurs, show a friendly message with a “retry” action

---

### 6. Summary

By following the plan above, you can transform the Student Dashboard into a robust, high-level snapshot of each student’s projects, showing critical data like:

- Project lists and validation progress
- Recently updated / failing features
- Tickets or tasks needing immediate attention
- Central actions for key workflows (Create Project, Open Tickets, etc.)

This design helps students quickly assess where to focus next and offers direct links to the more detailed project and feature pages already implemented in your codebase.
